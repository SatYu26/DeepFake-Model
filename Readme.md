# INTRODUCTION

Image animation consists of generating a video sequence so that an object in a source image is animated according to the motion of a driving video. The framework addresses this problem without using any annotation or prior information about the specific object to animate. Once trained on a set of videos depicting objects of the same category (e.g. faces, human bodies), this method can be applied to any object of this class.
